Even though this is not the final build (there are some issues in the Release files concerning textures and some in the networking part) it is fully playable and should have no issues. You can download a `.zip` for your OS [at the releases](https://github.com/Greece4ever/Chess3D/releases).

All the source code can be found at the `./Assets/src` part of the repository. The 3D Models were taken from the following sources (with some minor modifications)

- The [Horse](https://free3d.com/user/printable_models)
- All [the other pieces](https://www.cgtrader.com/items/2386070/download-page)
- The table was from [here](https://secure-files.cgtrader.com/uploads%2Ffiles%2F2541165%2FTableType_A.fbx?Expires=1609459894&Signature=lL0s45kg6gYn7N9hWU2mu70wkmuyLPu0eqMCuqeT6ynpkF8rOK8NFUCB6aaO47tTGgRT8R-ubX0qUQMYrLkbw-wsid-U65g~YnXubtMO0MFifYAD6DI5-Qw60ZY0yhB~7X2GXvPQR6IAIGIQt7cs~yYOrSL9H4Pmc0zZSyO4N18ciRBcn7d5eHW81gImvs2j08znYoMA9QKmhJvd0fpUyk0VHtIgsFHULO-E29dGr8IF-fSNe5UrSn1YMikyroXYyTmLnD4rwuzTXuNbPqFHXe-vaig-G13SXzfNE5Js1R9mbFBmb2HgFUpF7UX4x2bkC9fvuz-F876C31g6r9S1nw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJOY7BGXGJJCKGPZA)
